# Dormez
Dormez is an interpreted programming language. It supports the following:
* Primitive types (number, string, bool, etc.)
* Non-primitive types (console, file, etc.)
* If, else if, and else statements
* All kinds of loops
* Functions
* Lua-style tables
* Object-oriented programming

### Documentation
Check out the wiki to learn how to use Dormez and how it differs from other languages. https://github.com/markpwns1/Dormez/wiki

### How to Use
In the very near future I plan to add an official release, but until then you can clone this repository and build it all. You can then use `DormezInterpreter.exe` once you've built it.
